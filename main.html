      <p>Hello and welcome to our wedding website! We are excited to announce that, after a little over 2 years of happiness, 
	  we have decided to tie the knot. :) </p>
	  <p>We hope that you can join us as we celebrate and start our new life together.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="content_story" class="content" style="display: none">
      <p>We met on the very first day of our very first full-time jobs after college at Union Pacific Railroad in Omaha 
	  during new-hire in January 2009. Sweta noticed right away that David asked lots of intelligent questions and 
	  secretly thought he was cute. David thought the same about Sweta.</p>
	  
	  <p>In July 2009, we went on our first unofficial date -- mini-golfing, followed by Dairy Queen ice cream, 
	  followed by dinner. It was a perfect Sunday (pun intended :) ) and neither of us wanted the weekend to end! 
	  A few weeks afterwards, David went over to Sweta’s place one beautiful summer evening, and he ended up 
	  staying at her place till 4:30am -- during that time, they stared at the beautiful starry sky and 
	  rolled down the hill in Sweta’s apartment backyard. One week later, we officially became a couple!</p>
	  
	  <p>In May 2010, David got an offer from Google, all the way in California, and decided to accept it. 
	  He (painfully) left the love of his life in Omaha, but she decided to move in August to fulfill her 
	  lifelong dream of living in California. Shortly afterwards, Sweta started working at Mulesoft.
	  We have since been successfully been experiencing the joys of city life and no winters. :)</p>
	  
	  <p>David goes home for Thanksgiving in 2011 and realizes that all of his dreams and ambitions in life 
	  involve Sweta in one way or another. He asks his mom & dad for advice on how to propose and how to 
	  choose the perfect ring!</p>
	  
	  <p>On December 10, 2011, David brought Sweta to her most favorite place in the Bay Area - Stanford 
	  campus, and says that it’s time to take some pictures for the holidays. Around 3PM, David starts 
	  to set up his camera and tripod on the Stanford front-lawn. Finally, he says “We should take a
	  picture together. Hold on! I have a great prop -- it’s funny (clearly he’s saying this just to 
	  throw her off)!” Sweta then starts looking for a Santa hat or reindeer ears, but doesn’t find one. 
	  David finally comes over, and after about 20 seconds, he tells her that the camera is not actually 
	  taking a picture but rolling a video! Sweta is completely confused at this point... until 
	  David gets down on one knee and asks her to marry him! After saying “OMG! Are you serious?!?” about 
	  5 times, David says “Yes, I’m serious!” and after 2 seconds of shock from Sweta, David says “...so 
	  is that a yes or a no?” and she said “YES! Of course!”... and we have been engaged ever since!</p>
